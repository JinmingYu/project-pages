Andrew is currently a post-doctoral researcher in the MINED Group at Georgia Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D from the SUNCAT group at Stanford University where he developed methods for computational screening of catalyst materials usind density functional theory and microkinetic modeling. Andrew is originally from North Carolina, and received his undergraduate degree in Textile Engineering from NC State University where he participated in experimental research for the design of carbon nano-materials for lithium-ion battery anodes. Between his undergraduate and graduate studies Andrew spent 2 months as an intern at the NECTEC center near Bangkok, Thailand working on electrospinning of conductive polymers, and 10 months as a Fulbright scholar in Denmark where he conducted research on improving the efficiency of roll-to-roll processed polymer solar cells. Andrew is interested in leveraging materials informatics, statistics, and machine learning to maximize the practical impact of fundamental atomic-scale simulations.
